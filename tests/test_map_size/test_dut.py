"""Test addrmap size validation

Upstream test validates: regblock_pkg::REGBLOCK_SIZE == expected_size

Since Cocotb cannot directly access package parameters, this test serves as
a smoke test that the design elaborates correctly with the proper size constant.
The REGBLOCK_SIZE constant is validated at SystemVerilog compile/elaboration time.
